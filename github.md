Repositories: A repository (or "repo") is the central place where all project files, code, and documents are stored, organized, and tracked.
Branches: This feature allows developers to diverge from the main codebase to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the primary version of the code.
Pull Requests (PRs): Pull requests are a core collaboration tool, enabling developers to propose changes, request code reviews, discuss potential improvements, and track updates before merging their branch into the main project.
Issues and Bug Tracking: GitHub provides built-in issue-tracking tools to report bugs, request features, and discuss problems, which helps teams efficiently manage and resolve errors.
GitHub Actions: This feature allows for the automation of workflows, such as testing code, building projects, and deploying applications directly within the repository.
Code Hosting: GitHub offers cloud-based hosting for both public and private repositories, making projects accessible from anywhere with internet access.
Project Management Tools: Integrated project management features, including task boards, milestones, and issue assignment, help teams organize tasks and monitor progress effectively.
Wikis and Documentation: Users can create detailed documentation for their projects using the platform's wiki feature, helping other team members and users understand how the project works.
